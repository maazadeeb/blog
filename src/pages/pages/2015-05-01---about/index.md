Hi!

I'm Maaz Syed Adeeb. ðŸ¤“ I live in San Jose, CA. I'm working as a Software Development Engineer 2 (SDE 2) at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the RDS Aurora team. I work on the storage layer of Aurora, specifically in areas of disaster recovery, metadata management, and billing. I graduated from University of California, Irvine with a Masters in Computer Science in December 2021. I have over 5 years of work experience as a professional software dev, building enterprise analytics software for SAP.

I've been in love with computers and programming since I was a kid. I learned [Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>) in fourth grade and was fascinated by the patterns that I could generate by using simple `for` loops. I've not stopped since then.

I love building useful software and writing tests. Test Driven Development (TDD) interests me a lot. You won't have a conversation about programming with me, without me mentioning tests at some point!

In my free time, I like to eat various cuisines and play/watch soccer. Also, I love open source software and I like to make contributions wherever possible. I answer on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2950032/maazadeeb) whenever I can.

This blog will contain things I learn in my day to day life and I want to write as often as possible, since I'm always learning something. I also plan to share various life experiences, as I charter into unknown territory in a foreign land!

Hope to see you around! ðŸ‘»
