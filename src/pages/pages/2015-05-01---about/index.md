Hi!

I'm Maaz Syed Adeeb. 🤓 I'm from India and currently purusing my Masters in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine. I'm currently living in Irvine as well. I have over 5 years of work experience as a professional software dev, building enterprise analytics software for SAP.

I've been in love with computers and programming since I was a kid. I learned [Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>) in fourth grade and was fascinated by the patterns that I could generate by using simple for loops. I've not stopped since then.

I love building useful software and writing tests. Test Driven Development (TDD) interests me a lot. You won't have a conversation about programming with me, without me mentioning tests at some point!

In my free time, I like to eat various cuisines and play/watch soccer. Also, I love open source software and I like to make contributions where possible. I answer on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2950032/maazadeeb) whenever I can.

This blog will contain things I learn in my day to day life and I want to write as often as possible, since I'm always learning something. I also plan to share various life experiences, as I charter into unknown territory in a foreign land!

Hope to see you around! 👻
